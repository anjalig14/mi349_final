            <h3>The Importance of Food</h3>
            <address class="author">Anjali G</address>
            <time datetime="2022-10-30" title="October 30,2022">Oct 30, 2022</time>
            <p><img src="images/Produce.jpg" alt="The Importance of Food" ></p>
            <p> A widely stressed upon topic that is arrising is the importance of food. Quoted from Vandana Shiva, an Indian<br> 
                scholar, environmental activist, food sovereignty advocate, ecofeminist and anti-globalisation, quoted that<br> 
                "Food is a weapon". This is based on her reasoning that when you control weapons, you control armies. And when<br>
                you control food, you control society. But when you control seed you control life on earth. I think that this<br> 
                is a very important concern that should spark many people's attention. Whether we are aware of it or not, it<br> 
                is widely noticeable how much control the government and other industries have on the food industry. The chemicals<br>
                and pesticides used to make our source of fuel have immensely impacted our health which has possitively contributed<br>
                towards the revenue in the pharmaceutical industry. It is being assumed that the pharmaceutical industry and medical<br>
                industry aim is to not cure our issues but temper them through drugs by making us come back again when issues arise.<br> 
                A big contribution to a high amount of ill health is the food and products that we consume. That is why it is<br>
                important to understand where our food comes from and how it is harvested.</p>

            <h3>The Importance of Reading</h3>
            <address class="author">Anjali G</address>

            <p><img src="images/Reading.jpg" alt="The Art of Reading" ></p>
            <p> Our brains are very malleable. Therefore, it is very important to be able to d ifferentiate right from wrong.<br>
                In order to be able to build our intellegence and ability to decipher, we should make an effort to research<br> 
                and broaden our knowledge and persepctive about certain issues and topics. To do this, books will become your<br>
                best friend. It is essential to invest time into reading. No matter what  topic you wish to learn more about<br>
                whether it be finance, health, spirituality, self growth, books are your way there. There are many secrets and<br>
                useful points held in books that are not talked about. Reading not only heightens your knowledge, but it can improve<br>
                your communication skills, focus, and memory. It is important to stretch the flexibility of our mind. Due to short<br>
                videos that we see on social media platforms, our attention span and retention ability has weakened contributing to<br>
                our lack of focus. Not only that but we live in a very intergrated society. More than ever. Through books written<br>
                by authors from different time periods and places, there is most likely one person who has gone through the same<br>
                experiences as you. And by reading those books, you can seek them for the answers to your questions.</p>
